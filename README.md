# Facial-Expression-Recognition-using-keras

This Project is Created using TensorFlow, Keras and open-cv to perform live video Facial Expression Detection

Project is Fully functional By using pre-trained models created Using FER-2013 Dataset, However a utility 'training.py' is also providided in order to generate Models from Any other datasets
